This repository hosts the [Storage Standard](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Pull requests

See the [whatwg/html README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the general guidelines. Note that `source` is `storage.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments" here (I
know). Also, the Storage Standard uses [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to generate
`storage.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does not need
to contain the generated HTML.)
