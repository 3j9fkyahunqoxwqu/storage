This repository hosts the [Storage Standard](https://storage.spec.whatwg.org/).

### Code of conduct

We are committed to providing a friendly, safe and welcoming environment for all. Please read and
respect the [WHATWG Code of Conduct](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/Code_of_Conduct).

### Contribution opportunities

We've love your help fixing minor and larger issues with the Storage Standard. Pull requests for
typographical and grammar errors are also most welcome.

We'd be happy to mentor you through this process. If you're interested and need help getting
started, leave a comment on the issue or ask around [on IRC](https://wiki.whatwg.org/wiki/IRC).

### Pull requests

See the [html repository's README](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/README.md) for the
general guidelines. Note that `source` is `storage.bs` and "Acknowledgements" is "Acknowledgments"
here (I know). Also, the Storage Standard uses [bikeshed](https://github.com/tabatkins/bikeshed) to
generate `storage.html`. (Do not worry if using that tool is too complicated, your pull request does
not need to contain the generated HTML.)

### Merge policy

If you can commit to this repository, see the
[html repository's TEAM](https://github.com/whatwg/html/blob/master/TEAM.md) for guidelines.

### Tests
